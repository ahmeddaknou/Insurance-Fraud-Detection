# üïµÔ∏è Insurance Fraud Detection


## üìå Project Description

Insurance fraud is a serious and costly issue that affects the entire industry. In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent insurance claims based on a variety of customer, policy, and incident features. The goal is to help insurance companies better identify and investigate suspicious claims, reduce financial losses, and improve overall operational efficiency.

## üìÇ Dataset


The dataset used in this project is a synthetic auto insurance claims dataset, provided as part of a case study. It includes the following types of features:


**Categorical variables**
    - **Policy_state**: refers to the U.S. state in which the insurance policy was issued or registered.
    - **Policy_csl**: Combined Single Limit is the maximum amount an insurance company will pay for liability (bodily injury + property damage) per accident, regardless of how the money is split. Example: policy_csl = "250/500". This may refer to $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident.
    - **insured_sex**: sex of the insured person.
    - **insured_education_level**: Education level of the insured person.
    - **insured_occupation**: refers to the occupation or job title of the insured person (the person holding the insurance policy).
    - **insured_hobbies**: hobbies of the insured person.
    - **insured_relationship**: describes the relationship of the insured person to the primary policyholder.
    - **incident_type**: describes the nature or category of the insurance claim event.
    - **collision_type**: specifies the kind of impact or collision that occurred during the incident.
    - **incident_severity**: represents the level of damage or seriousness associated with the insurance incident.
    - **authorities_contacted**: indicates which authority (if any) was notified or involved during the insurance incident.
    - **incident_state**: refers to the U.S. state where the incident (e.g., accident, theft, etc.) occurred.
    - **incident_city**: refers to the U.S. city where the incident (e.g., accident, theft, etc.) occurred.
    - **incident_location**: The variable incident_location indicates the specific city or place where the insurance incident occurred.
    - **property_damage**: indicates whether the insurance incident involved damage to property other than the insured vehicle.
    - **police_report_available**: indicates whether a police report was filed and available in connection with the insurance claim.
    - **auto_make**: The variable auto_make refers to the manufacturer (brand) of the insured vehicle involved in the incident.
    - **auto_model**: refers to the specific model of the insured vehicle involved in the claim. It gives more detail than auto_make (which is the brand or manufacturer).


 **Numeric variables**  
    - **months_as_customer**: represents the number of months the person has been a customer of the insurance company.
    - **Age**: The variable age represents the age of the insured person.
    - **policy_number**: ID of policy.
    - **policy_deductible**: refers to the deductible amount set in the insurance policy.
    - **policy_annual_premium**: represents the total amount the customer pays for their insurance policy per year.
    - **umbrella_limit**: refers to the amount of additional liability coverage provided by an umbrella insurance policy
    - **insured_zip**: refers to the ZIP code (postal code) of the insured person's address ‚Äî typically the residence location of the policyholder.
    - **capital-gains**: refers to the amount of money gained from the sale of capital assets, such as property, stocks, or other investments.
    - **capital-loss**: refers to the amount of money lost from the sale of capital assets, such as property, stocks, or other investments.
    - **incident_hour_of_the_day**: represents the hour when the insurance-related incident occurred, typically using a 24-hour clock format.
    - **number_of_vehicles_involved**: represents the total number of vehicles involved in the insurance incident.
    - **bodily_injuries**: Total number of injured persons.
    - **witnesses**: represents the number of people who witnessed the incident.
    - **total_claim_amount**: refers to the total monetary value of the insurance claim submitted for a particular incident.
    - **injury_claim**: refers to the portion of the total claim amount that is attributed to bodily injury.
    - **property_claim**: represents the amount of the total insurance claim related to property damage.
    - **auto_year**: represents the portion of the total insurance claim that is related to vehicle damage ‚Äî that is, the repair or replacement costs   of the insured vehicle resulting from the incident.
    - **auto_year**: efers to the manufacturing year of the insured vehicle.
    - **policy_bind_year**: refers to the year when the insurance policy was activated or bound ‚Äî in other words, the start year of the coverage agreement between the insured person and the insurance company.

**Datetime Variables**: 

    - **policy_bind_date**:  is the date when the insurance policy started.
    - **incident_date**: is the date when the insurance incident occurred


**Target Variable**: fraud_reported (Y/N)

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline

The project follows a standard data science workflow:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics, missing values, feature distributions  
   - Chi¬≤ tests for categorical features  
   - Correlation analysis for numerical features  
   - Cram√©r‚Äôs V matrix for categorical feature dependencies

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)  
   - SMOTE for class imbalance (fraud cases are underrepresented)

3. **Modeling**  
   - Model: GradientBoostingClassifier,  Random Forest 
   - Pipeline includes SMOTE and preprocessing  
   - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV` 
   - Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Classification report and confusion matrix  
   - ROC and Precision-Recall curves  
   - Feature importance ranking


## üß† Key Learnings

- Fraud detection is a class imbalance problem ‚Äî metrics like **ROC AUC** and **Recall** are more useful than accuracy.
- Categorical feature encoding and thoughtful preprocessing significantly impact model performance.
- Gradient Boosting performs well with mixed-type tabular data and imbalanced classes.

## üìå Future Work

- Try other models: XGBoost, CatBoost, Logistic Regression  
- Use SHAP or LIME for better interpretability  
- Integrate real-time prediction interface (e.g., Flask app)
